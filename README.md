GZSper (GWAS Z-score to Single-cell Phenotypes for Expression Research) is a Python toolkit designed to bridge the gap between GWAS and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. By ingeniously translating GWAS Z-scores into single-cell phenotypes, GZSper empowers researchers to unravel the cellular intricacies of complex traits and diseases with unprecedented resolution.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üîó Integration of GWAS Z-scores with scRNA-seq data
- üß¨ Translation of genetic associations to single-cell phenotypes
- üé® Visualizations of GWAS-informed single-cell landscapes
- üöÄ Processing of large-scale genomic and transcriptomic datasets
- üîç Exploration of trait-associated gene expression patterns at single-cell resolution
- üìä Robust statistical analysis and data normalization
- üîÑ Adaptable to a wide spectrum of traits and diseases studied in GWAS

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Benjamin-JHou/GZSper.git
cd GZSper
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Usage

Embark on your GZSper journey with these simple steps:

### 1. üì• Data Fusion

```python
adata, zscore_df = load_data(adata_path, zscore_path)
```

**Problem Solved:** Seamlessly merges single-cell RNA-seq data with GWAS Z-scores, laying the foundation for integrated analysis.

### 2. üßÆ Phenotype Inference

```python
adata = calculate_phenotype_score(adata, zscore_df)
```

**Problem Solved:** Translates GWAS signals into meaningful single-cell phenotypes, revealing cells most influenced by trait-associated genetic variations.

### 3. üåà Phenotypic Landscape Visualization

```python
plot_umap(adata, color='cell_type', title='Cellular Diversity', save_path='cell_types_umap.png')
plot_umap(adata, color='gwas_phenotype', title='GWAS-Informed Cellular Phenotype', save_path='gwas_phenotype_umap.png')
```

**Problem Solved:** Crafts intuitive visualizations of cell type distributions and GWAS-informed phenotypes, unveiling trait-relevant cellular populations.

### 4. üéª Phenotypic Distribution Analysis

```python
plot_violin(adata, groupby='cell_type', values='gwas_phenotype', title='GWAS-Informed Phenotype by Cell Type', save_path='gwas_phenotype_violin.png')
```

**Problem Solved:** Compares GWAS-informed phenotypes across cell types, highlighting cellular populations most relevant to the studied trait or disease.

### 5. üîµ Gene-Phenotype Interplay

```python
plot_dotplot(adata, groupby='cell_type', var_names=top_genes_in_adata, title='Expression of Top GWAS-Identified Genes Across Cell Types', save_path='top_genes_dotplot.png')
```

**Problem Solved:** Visualizes expression patterns of key GWAS-identified genes across cell types, revealing cell-specific contributions to complex traits and diseases.

## üß™ Versatility Across Traits and Diseases

GZSper's adaptability spans the entire spectrum of GWAS-studied phenomena. By simply swapping GWAS Z-scores and single-cell datasets, researchers can illuminate cellular mechanisms underlying:

- Complex diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disorders, autoimmune conditions, neuropsychiatric illnesses)
- Quantitative traits (e.g., anthropometric measures, physiological parameters)
- Molecular phenotypes (e.g., gene expression variability, metabolomic profiles)
